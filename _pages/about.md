I'm a 3rd year PhD Student in Chemical Engineering at The Ohio State University advised by [Dr. Joel Paulson](https://cbe.osu.edu/people/paulson.82). My research interest lies in Bayesian Optimization, deterministic global optimization (spatial B&B algorithm), and Process System Engineering.


I received my BS and MS in Chemical Engineering at National Taiwan University, where I was advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Ward](https://che.ntu.edu.tw/che/en/jeffward.html). Click here for my CV.
